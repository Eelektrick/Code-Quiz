This is my password generator that operates after I added javascript to the webpage.

## My Journey with javescript for the password generator

This was a difficult assignment for me getting all the javascript and html to work exactly how I wanted it to.

so far this assignment took me the longest, due to difficulty and juggling being a parent(more on a personal level).

## How to use the password generator

First you need to click on the start button to start the quiz.

After that you will be given multiple questions and answering them in a timely manner will continue you all the way to the score screen.

You then put your initials witht the score you got and is saved into local storage.

After clicking submit you go to the final screen and choose to go back or to clear the saved scores and then click go back.
